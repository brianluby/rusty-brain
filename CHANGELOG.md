All notable changes to rusty-brain are documented here. The format is based on

## [Unreleased]

### Added — P4 agent surface

- **`rusty-brain-hooks` binary** (crate `rb-hooks`): a fail-open, capture-only
  per-event hook for JSON-protocol CLIs. Selected with `--agent <id>` for
  `claude-code`, `opencode`, `gemini`, or `codex` (Copilot deferred). It reads a
  hook event on stdin, captures mutating-tool observations (`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash`,
  deduped) into the daemon, injects recent high-importance memories on
  `SessionStart`, and **always exits 0** — it never blocks, never tracks memory
  debt, and never returns a non-zero exit.
- **`rusty-brain-install` binary** (crate `rb-install`): agent-surface — capture
  hooks + installer for **Claude Code, Gemini, and Codex** (OpenCode deferred —
  needs a JS/TS plugin, not a JSON hooks block). Merges a sentinel-marked
  (`rusty-brain`) hook block into each CLI's config, using that CLI's real hook
  event names and command form (Claude Code: exec `command`+`args`; Gemini —
  `SessionStart`/`AfterTool`/`SessionEnd`/`PreCompress` — and Codex use an inline
  quoted command string; SessionStart context is injected via
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`). Claude Code project
  `.claude/settings.json` by default, `--global` supported, with a `.bak`
  backup and atomic temp+fsync+rename. `uninstall` removes only the sentinel
  block, preserving any other user hooks. Supports `status` and `--dry-run`,
  with JSON or human output (non-TTY auto-selects JSON). Explicitly requesting
  `--agents opencode` returns a clear "deferred" error rather than silently doing
  nothing.
- **`rb-agents` crate**: the shared, CLI-agnostic spine — canonical `HookEvent`,
  per-CLI JSON adapters (`AgentCli`), a fail-open best-effort `DaemonClient` over
  `rb-proto`, namespace detection, and the install-side `AgentInstaller`
  contract.
- **CI `build-agents` job**: builds, lints, and tests `rb-agents`/`rb-hooks`/
  `rb-install`, and asserts via `cargo tree -e no-dev -p rusty-brain` that none
  of them enter the default `rusty-brain` binary closure.
- **`scripts/install-agents.sh`**: places the `rusty-brain-hooks` and
  `rusty-brain-install` binaries alongside `rusty-brain` in `~/.local/bin`,
  `chmod +x`, with SHA-256 verification of each copy.

### Notes

- The three agent-surface crates are workspace members but are **never** in the
  default `cargo build`/`rusty-brain`-binary dependency closure — no core crate
  depends on them. This keeps the daemon/CLI lean and is enforced in CI.
